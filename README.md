# MadLibs
Unit 2 Using Objects / String Methods

# Using Java Objects, Strings, and String Methods

In this Unit 2 project you will be creating your own **Halloween Themed Mad Lib**.
With this game you will continue to demonstrate how to create your own user defined object(s)
with its (their) own "state" and "behavior" while also using Scanner, Strings and various String methods.
An example of a traditional MadLib is included within this repo in pdf form for your reference.

### Project Specifications
  * You may ONLY use Java concepts from Unit 1 Primitive Types and Unit 2 Using Objects
  * Using any Java concepts outside of the first 2 Units will result in point reductions
  * Your project AND code MUST be your own (not a copy from a third party)
  * Your idea must have a **Halloween theme** and be appropriate for a public forum
  * The *MadLib* class will contain the "behind the scenes" material for your MadLib game including:
       * all instance variables,
       * all constructors,
       * and class methods necessary for your game to be complete
  * The *PlayMadLib* class will contain the main method where your MadLib game is actually played.
  * Your main method should include instantiation and calls for:
       * Your user input (Scanner class),
       * MadLib object(s),
       * and MadLib methods
  * Your MadLib should also demonstrate your understanding and use of the following **String Methods**:

       * indexOf
       * equals
       * compareTo

  * Your MadLib should also include the following **escape sequences**:
       *  \\"
       *  \\\
       *  \n
       *  \t
  *  The use of the above escape sequences must be directly related to and contribute significantly to your MadLib
